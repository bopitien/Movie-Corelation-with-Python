# Movie-Corelation-with-Python

## Context

The aim of this analysis is to examine the relationship between;
1. Movie budget and Gross revenue
2. Company and Gross revenue


There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, between 1986-2016).The data will be cleaned using various steps and properly formated to enable proper analysis to be carried out. Later on a corelation test and regression plot will be used to examine the relationship betweeen the selected variables.

## About Data

There are 6820 movies in the dataset (220 movies per year, 1986-2016). Each movie has the following attributes:

budget: the budget of a movie. Some movies don't have this, so it appears as 0

company: the production company

country: country of origin

director: the director

genre: main genre of the movie.

gross: revenue of the movie

name: name of the movie

rating: rating of the movie (R, PG, etc.)

released: release date (YYYY-MM-DD)

runtime: duration of the movie

score: IMDb user rating

votes: number of user votes

star: main actor/actress

writer: writer of the movie

year: year of release

## summary of Findings

From the analysis it is evident that Budget of the movies has a strong positive corelation with the gross earnings. This means that the more money 
invested in the movie project like top rated actors, cinematography, marketing and ads the most likely better performance of the movies.
It is also important to note that the production company has a weak postive corelation with the gross revenue which implies that the company might not necessarily 
influence the outcome o the movie.
One notable result is the votes are postively corelated with the gross revenue. Movies that turn in high revenues based on performance are likely to receive more votes. Generally it is well known that corelation is not causation , therefore other factors might affect the performance of movies.
